The Earthquake
(After the worst earthquake in North American history shocked Anchorage, in Alaska, the city leaned on an unlikely saviour to see it through the disaster.) 

Genie Chance was typing a letter to a friend when her thirteen-year-old son, Winston Junior, known as Wins, appeared at her bedroom door. 

He needed a ride into downtown Anchorage to buy a copy of the Red Cross lifesaving manual for swim class the next day. 

The bookstore didn't close until six o'clock. It was almost five o'clock in the evening. They still had time. 

Genie set her letter aside. "You've known for a week that you had to have it," she complained as they headed downstairs. 

Genie's eleven-year-old son, Albert, was watching television in the living room. "We should be gone in five minutes time," Genie told him. Her husband, known to all as Big Winston, was still at work, and Genie's youngest, eight-year-old Jan, was at the neighbour's house. Genie pulled on her boots and parka and marshalled Wins into the car. 




That wasn't the first time that day, March 27, 1964 - Good Friday - that Genie had been in town. She had set out for the city's Public Safety Building at about seven in the morning as she did every morning, to sift through the police department's overnight logs and booking slips, looking for news stories. It was half past five in the evening. 



The traffic light turned red as Genie and Wins approached the intersection of C Street and Ninth.  The car started bucking as soon as Genie's foot touched the brake pedal. "Oh no," she said. She assumed she had blown a tyre. 



For a moment, they bounced violently without speaking a word. The shaking relented, and then came a forceful, heaving jolt.  It knocked the traffic lights out. The electrical lines overhead started snapping like whips. 


"What is it?" Wins asked. 

"It must be a hard wind," Genie said. Across the street, cars parked at the service station were bouncing into one another and separating again. They looked like grotesque accordion opening and closing, Genie thought. A man and two women came out of a liquor store to her left. They did not seem to be walking, exactly, but lurching. Then they fell down. 





When they got back on their feet, the man tried to protect the two women by pinning each one to the wall of the building they had just stumbled out of. But then the building swayed away from the three of them - the building itself moved!  Genie watched it bending left, then right. As it did so, she saw a crack open in the masonry, over the man's head and then close again. 



Through the windshield, Genie watched the road roll away from the car. The pavement didn't break apart; it was still solid, but it rolled, wavelike, as though some humpbacked shadow creature surged under its surface. As Genie's car hopped more ferociously, leaving the ground and edging into the adjacent lane, she found the words to explain the chaos: "This is an earthquake!" 


The onset of the quake unfolded like this for many people. The mayor of Anchorage stared at a raven outside his car window. He watched it for several seconds as it tried to land on a thrashing street light until finally the bird gave up and soared off. A woman watched her cast-iron pot of beef stew hop autonomously off the fireplace. 




The earth yawned open and swallowed cars. One woman, watching hers vanish, said, "Good!" out loud. She had never liked that car, but then the ground thrust upward and ejected the vehicle again. Another woman found herself jumping over one-metre-wide crevices as they split open in front of her, escaping to momentary safety again and again, cradling her baby the whole time. She noticed, fortuitously, that each new rupture was preceded by an audible warning that sounded as if "you dropped a dish and it didn't break, just bounced," she later explained. 




The Great Alaska Earthquake, as it came to be known, was the most powerful earthquake ever measured at that time and remains the second most powerful one to date. Its magnitude hit 9.2 on the Richter scale. Its epicentre was one hundred and twenty-one kilometres east of Anchorage and shallow, only about twenty-five kilometres underground. 



The earthquake was so violent that it reshaped the surface of the planet as it went. An uninhabited island, southeast of Anchorage, was knocked nearly twenty-one metres from its original position. Most of the landmass of North America momentarily jostled upward, in some places by as much as five centimetres. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 6 436 kilometres away - a homeowner noticed his swimming pool jiggle. The quake lasted nearly five minutes, long enough for some people to question whether it would ever stop. 





Genie and Wins raced back home. Their strong, wood-shingled duplex was still standing, though the chimney had crumbled. As they pulled up, Jan and Albert shot out of the neighbour's house.  "You ought to see the inside of our house!" Albert shouted. "It's a mess!" 



Safe and reunited with each other, the Chance children understood that Genie would be leaving again to report on the situation. She hugged Albert and asked, "Are you sure you're right?"  "Don't worry about me," he said. "Go on and do your job." Genie hugged him again and ran out to her car. 



It was nearly six o'clock when Genie parked downtown and slammed the car door behind her. The true scope of the horror and destruction now hit her. On D Street, Genie stopped short in front of a slab of something in the snow. She stared at it, mesmerised and repulsed, but couldn't place what it was.  Finally, a man explained: It was half a woman. He had seen her get struck by the falling debris. 





Genie, feeling nauseated, moved on quickly. On Fifth Avenue, the roof of the new J.C. Penney had slumped inward and massive swaths of the five-story exterior had collapsed, spilling plaster, lumber, and concrete up and down the block. It looked as though someone had stepped on the structure and its insides had slipped out. Volunteers were clearing debris off a flattened car with their bare hands. A fifty-five-year-old woman was inside, her neck and arm broken, but she was alive. 




Genie turned the corner onto Fourth Avenue and took in that impossible panorama. While one side of the city's main thoroughfare seemed untouched by the earthquake, the other side of the street had simply dropped. For two whole blocks, everything was three or so metres lower than it had been, wedged in a ragged chasm that had ripped open under the street. Some of the buildings still appeared to be intact down there. Cars were lined up beside their parking metres. 




The D & D Bar, the Sportsman's Club, the Frisco Bar and Caf√©, the pawnshop, the Anchorage Arcade - they were all now below ground level. In the immediate aftermath, men had emerged from the front doors of those sunken bars unharmed, many still clutching their drinks, and looked up like stunned miners. 


After briefly returning home again to check on her family, Genie called in to the station on her car's two-way radio, while still parked in her driveway. She was prepared to make an initial report about the destruction she had witnessed downtown. Though the station had been knocked off the air for a time, it was now back. "Go ahead, Genie," the on-air announcer said. 





Genie was ready, but wondered how she could proceed. She felt obligated to shield KENI's listeners from the horror she had witnessed. She intuited that if she described that body in the snow or the woman in the car, listeners would rush to assume it was their missing mother, wife, sister, or daughter. "A description of blood and the gory scenes could cause panic. We could not have panic," Genie would later explain. 



Speaking fast, between sharp, quick breaths, Genie told those listening, "It has become obvious that the earthquake that struck Anchorage was a major one. A great deal of damage has been done throughout the city." She advised people to check their supplies and keep their doors closed to retain the heat in their homes since the temperature would be in the high 20s.  "But, uh, now another thing," she continued. She was making it up as she went along, warning about as many hazards as she could remember from when she had dashed through downtown: "Avoid tall buildings, which may still be susceptible to aftershocks; stay clear of power lines; stay put.  And most of all, don't panic. Check on your neighbours. See if they have transistor radios. If they don't, maybe they could move in with you and share one for the night. It seems like it's going to be a long, cold night for Anchorage, so prepare to batten down the hatches, and stay tuned to KENI." 




Another tremor struck just as Genie finished. There were other fifty-two separate aftershocks over the next three days, eleven of which measured higher than 6.0. When the aftershock subsided, Genie drove back downtown. It was just after half past six in the evening. Only one hour had passed since the quake. 



"For the next thirty hours," she would say later, "I talked constantly."
