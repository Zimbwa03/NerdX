        content: `**What is History?**
History is more than just memorising dates and names. It is the inquiry into the human past, seeking to understand how societies, cultures, and nations have evolved over time.

**Key Definitions:**
- **The Past:** Everything that has happened before this moment.
- **History:** The *study* of the past, often based on written records.
- **Prehistory:** The period of time before written records were kept.
- **Historiography:** The study of how history is written and how historical interpretations change over time.

**Why Study History?**
1.  **Understanding the Present:** To understand current problems (e.g., land issues in Zimbabwe), we must look at their historical roots (e.g., colonialism).
2.  **Identity and Heritage:** History gives individuals and nations a sense of who they are and where they come from.
3.  **Critical Thinking:** It teaches us to analyse evidence, detect bias, and understand different perspectives.
4.  **Learning from Mistakes:** By studying past failures (e.g., wars, economic collapses), we can hope to avoid repeating them.
5.  **Inspiration:** Learning about great leaders and movements can inspire current and future generations.`,

        title: 'Sources of History',
        content: `Historians rely on evidence to build a picture of the past. This evidence comes from **sources**.

### Primary Sources
**Definition:** Original, first-hand accounts or evidence created *during* the time period being studied.

| Type | Examples | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Written** | Diaries, letters, government records, newspapers, treaties. | Provide specific details, dates, and names. | Can be biased, incomplete, or deteriorated. Literacy was limited in the past. |
| **Oral** | Interviews, songs, poems, traditions passed down by word of mouth. | preserves culture in societies without writing; captures emotions. | Memory can fade or change over time; "Chinese whispers" effect. |
| **Visual** | Photographs, paintings, cartoons, films. | Capture moments in time; show fashion, architecture, etc. | Can be staged, edited, or misinterpreted. |
| **Physical (Archaeology)** | Tools, pottery, weapons, buildings (ruins), coins, skeletons. | Provide evidence of how people lived, what they ate, and their technology. | Can be difficult to date precisely; require expert interpretation. |

### Secondary Sources
**Definition:** Accounts created *after* the event by someone who did not experience it first-hand. They analyse and interpret primary sources.

**Examples:**
- History textbooks
- Documentaries
- Biographies written long after the subject's death
- Articles by historians

**Importance:** Secondary sources help us understand the bigger picture by combining evidence from many primary sources.`,

3.  **Economic History:** Studies how people made a living, trade, agriculture, industry, and economic systems. (e.g., Trans-Saharan trade).
4.  **Cultural History:** Examines art, music, religion, language, and ideas.
