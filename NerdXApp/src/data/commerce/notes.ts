### What is Properties?
Production is the creation of utility (satisfaction). It includes the extraction of raw materials, processing them into finished goods, and distributing them to the consumer.

### Classification of Production

There are three main stages (types) of production:

1.  **Primary Production (Extractive Industry)**
    *   Involves obtaining raw materials directly from nature.
    *   **Examples:** Agriculture (farming), Mining (gold, coal), Fishing, Forestry, Quarrying.
    *   This is the first stage of production.

2.  **Secondary Production (Manufacturing & Construction)**
    *   Involves processing raw materials into finished or semi-finished goods.
    *   **Manufacturing:** Turning raw materials into goods (e.g., furniture making, car assembly, food processing).
    *   **Construction:** Building roads, bridges, houses, and dams.
    *   This stage adds **form utility**.

3.  **Tertiary Production (Services)**
    *   Involves the provision of services that support industry and consumers.
    *   **Commercial Services (Aids to Trade):** Transport, Banking, Insurance, Warehousing, Communication, Advertising.
    *   **Direct Personal Services:** Teachers, Doctors, Musicians, Hairdressers.
    *   This stage ensures goods reach the consumer.

### Branches of Production

| Branch | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Industry** | Extraction and processing of goods | Mining, Manufacturing |
| **Commerce** | Distribution of goods and services | Trade + Aids to Trade |
| **Direct Services** | Personal services to consumers | Doctors, Entertainers |

        title: 'Factors of Production',
        content: `
Production requires four inputs effectively combined by the entrepreneur.

| Factor | Description | Reward | Nature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Land** | All natural resources (soil, minerals, water, climate) | **Rent** | Passive, fixed in supply |
| **Labour** | Human physical and mental effort used in production | **Wages/Salaries** | Active, mobile, perishable |
| **Capital** | Man-made resources used to produce other goods (machines, money, buildings) | **Interest** | Man-made, depreciates |
| **Entrepreneurship** | The risk-taking and organising factor | **Profit** | Active, decision-making |

### Specialisation and Division of Labour

**Division of Labour:** Breaking down a production process into smaller, specialized tasks performed by different workers.

**Advantages:**
*   Increased output and efficiency.
*   Saves time and tools.
*   Workers become experts in their tasks.
*   Facilitates use of machinery.

**Disadvantages:**
*   Monotony and boredom for workers.
*   Loss of craftsmanship (pride in work).
*   Interdependence – a strike in one section stops the whole process.
*   Risk of unemployment if skills become obsolete.

        title: 'Home Trade',
        content: `
**Home Trade** occurs within the boundaries of a country. It consists of Wholesale Trade and Retail Trade.

### 1. Wholesale Trade
The wholesaler buys in bulk from producers and sells in smaller quantities to retailers.

**Functions of the Wholesaler:**
*   **Breaking Bulk:** Buying large quantities and selling small lots.
*   **Warehousing:** Storing goods until they are needed, stabilizing prices.
*   **Financing:** Paying producers early and giving credit to retailers.
*   **Information:** Advising producers on market trends.
*   **Transport:** Moving goods from factories to the market.

**Elimination of the Wholesaler:**
*   *Can be eliminated when:* Goods are perishable, expensive (e.g., machinery), or customized. Large retailers (supermarkets) often buy directly from producers.
*   *Cannot be eliminated when:* Small retailers need credit and variety; producers need wide distribution.

### 2. Retail Trade
The retailer buys from wholesalers (or producers) and sells in small units to the final consumer.

**Functions of the Retailer:**
*   Selling in convenient quantities.
*   Providing variety and choice.
*   Offering personal advice and credit to loyal customers.
*   Located near consumers.

**Types of Retailers:**
*   **Small Scale:** Hawkers, peddlers, kiosks, general dealers, tuckshops.
*   **Large Scale:**
    *   *Department Stores:* Many shops under one roof (e.g., Barbours/Meikles type).
    *   *Chain Stores (Multiples):* Many branches, centralized buying (e.g., OK, TM Pick n Pay).
    *   *Supermarkets:* Self-service, wide variety, pre-packaged goods.
    *   *Hypermarkets:* Very large supermarkets on outskirts (e.g., Makro - though strictly wholesale cash & carry, functions similarly in scale).
    *   *Mail Order:* Selling via catalogues/post (historical, now e-commerce).

### 1. Road Transport
*   **Pros:** Flexible (door-to-door), good for short distances, varied vehicle types.
*   **Cons:** Traffic congestion, accidents, limited capacity compared to rail, delays.

### 2. Rail Transport (e.g., NRZ)
*   **Pros:** Carriers bulky/heavy goods, cheap for long distances, reduces road congestion, containerisation.
*   **Cons:** Fixed routes (stations only), high maintenance of tracks, slow, expensive for short distances, delays.

### 3. Air Transport
*   **Pros:** Speed (fastest), safety for valuables, reaches remote areas (helicopters).
*   **Cons:** Very expensive, limited carrying capacity, affected by weather, airports far from centers.
*   **Best for:** Perishables (flowers), valuables (gold), emergency supplies, urgent documents.

### 4. Water Transport (Sea/Inland)
*   **Pros:** Cheapest for heavy bulk (oil, coal, containers), huge capacity (super-tankers).
*   **Cons:** Very slow, dependent on ports/weather.

### 5. Pipeline
*   **Use:** Liquids and gases (Oil, Water).
*   **Pros:** Continuous flow, low running cost, safe from theft.
*   **Cons:** High setup cost, inflexible route, targets for sabotage.
