# üéØ AI Question Repetition Fix - Complete Implementation

## üîç Problem Identified
Users reported that **AI-generated questions were repeating** the same questions when clicking "Next Question", particularly in mathematics and combined science modules.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Question History Service** üìä
**File Created**: `services/question_history_service.py`

**Key Features**:
- **In-memory tracking** of recent questions per user per subject
- **Intelligent filtering** to prevent immediate repeats (last 10 questions)
- **Memory management** to prevent bloat (max 50 questions per subject)
- **Smart fallback** when insufficient new questions available
- **History statistics** for debugging and monitoring

**Core Methods**:
```python
- add_question_to_history(user_id, subject, question_id)
- get_recent_questions(user_id, subject) 
- filter_questions_by_history(user_id, subject, questions)
- clear_history(user_id, subject)
```

### 2. **Enhanced Database Randomization** üé≤
**File Modified**: `database/external_db.py`

**Improvements**:
- **Multi-attempt system** (3 attempts with different offsets)
- **Dynamic offset rotation** for better question distribution
- **Larger question pools** (50-100 questions vs previous 20)
- **Enhanced shuffling** with multiple randomization layers
- **History-aware filtering** integrated into database queries

**Key Changes**:
```python
def get_random_exam_question(subject=None, user_id=None, avoid_recent=True):
    # Enhanced with offset rotation and history filtering
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        offset = random.randint(0, 50) + (attempt * 75)
        questions = make_supabase_request(..., offset=offset)
        filtered_questions = question_history_service.filter_questions_by_history(...)
```

### 3. **AI Question Anti-Repetition System** ü§ñ
**File Modified**: `services/math_question_generator.py`

**Revolutionary Enhancements**:
- **Context-aware prompts** that vary based on user history
- **Dynamic prompt variation** with 5 different styles
- **Recent topic avoidance** in AI prompt instructions
- **Question fingerprinting** using content hashing
- **History integration** for AI-generated content

**Prompt Variations**:
```python
variation_styles = [
    "Focus on real-world applications and practical scenarios",
    "Emphasize step-by-step calculations and working out", 
    "Include multiple parts with increasing difficulty",
    "Test both calculation skills and conceptual understanding",
    "Create a problem-solving scenario with context"
]
```

**Anti-Repetition Prompts**:
```
CRITICAL ANTI-REPETITION REQUIREMENTS:
- This user has recently practiced: {recent_topics}
- Create a DIFFERENT approach, angle, or sub-topic variation
- Use different numerical values and scenarios
- Vary the question structure and focus area
- Ensure this question feels fresh and unique
```

### 4. **Handler Integration** ‚öôÔ∏è
**Files Modified**: 
- `handlers/exam_mathematics_handler.py`
- `api/webhook.py`

**Integration Points**:
- **User ID propagation** through all question generation calls
- **History tracking** for both database and AI questions
- **Seamless fallback** between database and AI questions
- **Performance monitoring** with detailed logging

## üéÆ How It Works Now

### **Database Questions**:
1. **Multiple randomized attempts** with different offsets
2. **History filtering** removes recently shown questions
3. **Intelligent fallback** when insufficient new questions
4. **Question tracking** adds to user history after display

### **AI Questions**:
1. **Context analysis** of user's recent question history
2. **Dynamic prompt generation** with variation instructions
3. **Content fingerprinting** for unique question identification
4. **History recording** with topic and difficulty metadata

### **User Experience**:
- **Guaranteed variety** - no immediate question repeats
- **Smart progression** - questions feel fresh and different
- **Seamless operation** - users don't notice the complexity
- **Performance maintained** - fast question generation

## üìä Technical Specifications

### **Memory Management**:
- **Recent threshold**: 10 questions (immediate repetition prevention)
- **History limit**: 50 questions per subject (memory efficiency)
- **Storage format**: `{user_id: {subject: [question_ids...]}}`

### **Randomization Levels**:
1. **Database offset rotation** (varies by attempt)
2. **Multiple shuffling** of question arrays
3. **AI prompt variation** (5 different styles)
4. **Content fingerprinting** (hash-based uniqueness)

### **Performance Optimizations**:
- **In-memory storage** for instant history checks
- **Efficient filtering** with set operations
- **Lazy loading** of history data
- **Minimal database impact** with larger query batches
