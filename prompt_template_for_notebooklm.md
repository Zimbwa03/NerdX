## PROMPT TEMPLATE:

```
You are an expert Cambridge AS & A Level Chemistry educator. Generate comprehensive, exam-focused study notes for the topic: [TOPIC NAME].

CONTEXT:
This topic is part of the Cambridge International AS & A Level Chemistry syllabus. The notes should be written at [LEVEL] standard and fall under [CATEGORY]. The topic description is: [TOPIC DESCRIPTION].

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NOTES:

1. STRUCTURE:
   Create detailed notes following this exact structure:
   - Title: "Cambridge AS & A Level Chemistry: Comprehensive Study Notes on [TOPIC NAME]"
   - Introduction section explaining the topic's importance and context
   - Multiple numbered sections (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.) with descriptive titles
   - Each section should have subsections where appropriate (e.g., 1.1, 1.2)
   - Include worked examples where calculations or problem-solving are involved
   - End with a comprehensive summary or conclusion

2. CONTENT STYLE:
   - Write in an academic yet accessible tone suitable for A Level students
   - Use clear, precise explanations with technical terminology used correctly
   - Include chemical equations, formulas, and reactions where relevant
   - Explain mechanisms step-by-step for organic reactions
   - Use bullet points and tables for clarity
   - Include comparative analyses where multiple concepts are covered
   - Add "Examiner's Tips" or "Examiner's Notes" in key sections
   - Highlight common exam errors or misconceptions

3. FORMATTING:
   - Use markdown formatting with clear headers (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
   - Include tables using markdown table syntax when comparing concepts
   - Use **bold** for key terms and important points
   - Use numbered lists for step-by-step processes
   - Use bullet points for lists and key features
   - Include chemical formulas in proper notation (subscripts, superscripts)
   - Separate major sections with horizontal rules (---)

4. KEY ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE:
   - Definitions of key terms (clearly marked)
   - Reaction mechanisms with step-by-step explanations
   - Worked examples with detailed solutions
   - Comparison tables where relevant
   - Experimental observations and results
   - Industrial applications if applicable
   - Environmental considerations if relevant
   - Qualitative tests and identification methods
   - Factors affecting reactions/processes
   - Trends and patterns with explanations

5. EXAM FOCUS:
   - Highlight topics frequently tested in examinations
   - Include common question types and how to approach them
   - Explain why certain answers are incorrect
   - Provide memory aids or mnemonics where helpful
   - Connect concepts to other topics in the syllabus

6. DEPTH AND SCOPE:
   - Cover the topic comprehensively but at the appropriate level
   - Include all essential concepts required by the Cambridge syllabus
   - Explain the "why" behind concepts, not just the "what"
   - Make connections to related topics
   - Include real-world applications and examples

7. STYLE CONSISTENCY:
   Follow the style and depth of these example topics:
   - Equilibria (dynamic equilibrium, Le Châtelier's Principle, Kc calculations, pH)
   - Electrochemistry (redox, half-equations, standard electrode potentials, electrolysis)
   - Halogen Compounds (nucleophilic substitution, SN1/SN2 mechanisms, elimination)
   - Chemical Bonding (ionic, covalent, metallic bonding, VSEPR, intermolecular forces)
   - States of Matter (particle models, kinetic theory, gas laws, solid structures)

8. OUTPUT FORMAT:
   Generate the notes as a single, well-structured markdown document that can be directly used. The notes should be comprehensive enough to serve as a complete study resource for students preparing for their Cambridge A Level Chemistry examinations.

## ADDITIONAL TIPS:

1. If the topic has calculations (like Reaction Kinetics, Chemical Energetics), emphasize including:
   - Step-by-step worked examples
   - Formula derivations
   - Unit conversions
   - Common calculation pitfalls

2. If the topic has mechanisms (like Hydrocarbons, Benzene), emphasize:
   - Arrow-pushing mechanisms
   - Intermediate structures
   - Conditions for each step
   - Stereochemical considerations

3. If the topic has trends (like Group 2, Group 17, Periodic Table), emphasize:
   - Comparative tables
   - Explanations of trends
   - Exceptions and their reasons
   - Comparison across periods and groups

4. If the topic has applications (like Polymerisation, Analytical Techniques), emphasize:
   - Real-world examples
   - Industrial processes
   - Practical uses
   - Environmental impact

5. After generating the notes, you can add a follow-up request:
   "Please also provide a summary with 15-20 key points and 12-15 exam tips for this topic in bullet format."
