# What NerdX Does — Overview for Schools

**Purpose:** Share this page with school administrators, teachers, and parents when introducing NerdX.  
**Use:** Add as a separate page in your school proposal pack, or hand it out during school visits.

---

## 1. What is NerdX?

**NerdX** is an AI-powered study companion that helps students prepare for **O-Level and A-Level** examinations. It supports **two exam bodies**:

- **ZIMSEC** (Zimbabwe School Examinations Council) — the national curriculum and exams used in Zimbabwean schools.
- **Cambridge** — Cambridge IGCSE (O-Level) and Cambridge International AS & A Level, used in many schools across Zimbabwe, Africa, and internationally.

Students can use NerdX whether their school follows **ZIMSEC**, **Cambridge**, or both. All core subjects are aligned to the syllabi and exam styles of both bodies. **More subjects and topics will be added over time** as we expand the platform.

---

## 2. How Students Access NerdX

Students use NerdX in **two ways**, with the **same account and same credits**:

1. **NerdX mobile application** — iOS and Android app (download from app stores or your direct link).
2. **WhatsApp bot** — study via chat on WhatsApp.

They can switch between the app and WhatsApp at any time; progress and credits are shared. Schools can offer the package and let students choose the channel they prefer.

## 3. Curricula and Exam Bodies

### ZIMSEC (Zimbabwe)

- **O-Level:** ZIMSEC Ordinary Level — Mathematics, Combined Science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), English, and related topics.
- **A-Level:** ZIMSEC Advanced Level — Pure Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and other subjects as implemented.
- Content is aligned to ZIMSEC syllabi, command words, and examination style so practice feels like real ZIMSEC exams.

### Cambridge

- **O-Level / IGCSE:** Cambridge IGCSE — same subject areas (Mathematics, Combined Science, English, etc.).
- **A-Level:** Cambridge International AS & A Level — e.g. Mathematics (9709, 9231), Physics (9702), Chemistry (9701), Biology (9700), and others as we add them.
- Content supports Cambridge syllabus codes and question styles so students preparing for Cambridge exams get relevant practice.

### Going Forward

We continuously add and refine topics. **More subjects and syllabi will be added** so that NerdX stays useful as curricula and school needs evolve.
